## Context

The text to move sits in three places in `README.md`:

- `## ⚙️ lets sync` and its four subsections (lines 745-863).
- `### Resolvers` under Fresh sessions (617-655), and
  `#### Switching from lets-delegate-resolver` (677-690).
- `### From 0.1` and `### From a version that linked the skills` under
  Updating (904-936).

`docs/resolver-contract.md` already says most of what "Resolvers" says.
It also holds a full copy of `contrib/headless-resolver`, which a bats
test pins to the file.

Links into the moved text: the README's own `#committed-or-ignored-skills`
(twice). The README's `#resolvers` link keeps its target, because the
heading stays. The contrib READMEs link only to `#set-up-delegation`,
which stays.

Links out of the moved text: the "Switching" note links to
`#set-up-delegation` in the README.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Each fact has one home. Text moves; it is not copied.
- Moved text keeps its wording, apart from headings and links that the
  new page needs. A link in moved text that targets the README becomes
  `../README.md#<anchor>`.

**Non-Goals:**

- Rewriting what stays in the README. The front-door story does that.
- Moving the monorepo notes, the vocabulary, or the mise snippet.

## Test Seams

- **Primary test seam:** `tests/skill-interfaces.bats`, run by
  `pnpm test`.
- **Existing seams reused:** the test that checks how the docs name
  `lets delegate review` and `handoff`. `nix flake check` builds the
  release, which does not include `docs/`.

## Scrutiny Tier & Blast Radius

- **Tier:** low
- **Blast radius:** `README.md`, `docs/`, one bats file. No code and no
  release content.

## Decisions

**`docs/lets-sync.md` takes the whole section.** It gets the section's
intro, the command table, the list of what each run does, the exit
codes, and the four subsections, in the same order. The README keeps the
`## ⚙️ lets sync` heading and one sentence: what the command does, and a
link to the page. The two `#committed-or-ignored-skills` links point at
`docs/lets-sync.md#committed-or-ignored-skills`.

**`docs/upgrading.md` is ordered by release, newest first.** The
sections are:

1. 0.5: the default now answers as `subagent` (the note now in
   "Resolvers").
2. 0.5: `lets-delegate-resolver` is gone (the "Switching" subsection and
   its table).
3. `lets-sync` is now `lets sync` (added in 0.3).
4. From a version that linked the skills (added in 0.1).

The README's Updating section keeps its opening, "With Nix" and "With
mise", and ends with one sentence that links to the page.

**Resolvers folds into the contract's "How `lets` finds a resolver".**
The contract lacks two facts, and gains them there:

- For a review, the default runs nothing: `lets delegate review run`
  exits 3, and the review skill runs a subagent.
- For a handoff, the default writes the prompt to
  `.workspace/lets-delegate/<name>.prompt.md`, and gives back the prompt
  and that path.
Everything else in "Resolvers" is already in the contract, and is
dropped. That includes what `lets` does when a session fails: the
contract's exit code table says it. The README keeps the `### Resolvers`
heading and one sentence: a resolver is the program that turns a request
into a real session, and the contract's "How `lets` finds a resolver"
says how `lets` picks one. So the README's `#resolvers` link still
works.

**The script copy goes.** The contract keeps the sentences that link to
`contrib/headless-resolver` and say what it does, and the sentence that
it leaves out the timeout. The code block and the test "the resolver
contract shows contrib/headless-resolver as it is" go. An excerpt was
the alternative, but it still needs a test to stay true, and the file is
one click away.

**The docs-naming test reads every page in `docs/`.** It now lists
`README.md` and `docs/resolver-contract.md`. It changes to `README.md`
and `docs/*.md`, so the two new pages are covered. The glob stays
outside quotes, as `'$repo'/docs/*.md`, like the contrib glob beside it.
A quoted glob matches no file, and the test would pass while reading
nothing. No other test reads
the moved text.

No decision here is costly to reverse, so none needs an ADR.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [A fact is lost in the move] → Before deleting each README section,
  check every sentence against its new page or the contract.
- [A link breaks] → Grep the repository for `](#` targets and
  `README.md#` after the move, and follow each new link to a heading
  that exists.

## Migration & Rollback

N/A. Revert the commits to undo.
