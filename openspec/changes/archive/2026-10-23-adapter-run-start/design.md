## Context

The kit in `contrib/resolver-kit/` turns protocol verbs into calls on one
`Adapter`. Two adapters use it: cli (`contrib/cli-resolver/src/cli.ts`)
and t3 (`contrib/t3-resolver/src/t3.ts`). The subagent resolver answers
verbs on its own, through `runProgram`, and does not use `Adapter`.

Today `resolver.ts` does this for `run`:

1. `adapter.spawn(...)` with `kind: 'run'` and `readOnly: true`.
2. `adapter.waitForResult(session, { timeoutMs })`.
3. Rejects an empty text.
4. On any error, appends `(<kind> <id>)` to the message. On `Refused`,
   calls the kit's own `finish` with `ok: true` first.

For `start`, it calls `spawn` with `kind: 'start'`, `effort: null` and
`readOnly: false`, and returns the handle. It declines a verb that is not
in `adapter.verbs`, which defaults to both.

The constraint is that nothing on the wire changes: requests, responses,
exit codes and the spec stay as they are.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Each adapter method does one whole job, so a new adapter has nothing
  to fake.
- Less code in the kit and in cli.

**Non-Goals:**

- Any change to the protocol, exit codes or spec.
- Changes to the subagent or headless resolvers.
- Reworking t3's thread launch or result polling beyond moving them into
  `run` and `start`.

## Test Seams

- **Primary test seam:** each program end to end through
  `tests/resolver-kit/fixtures/handle.ts`: a verb and a request in, the
  exit code, stdout and stderr out. `tests/cli-resolver/resolver.test.ts`
  and `tests/t3-resolver/resolver.test.ts` already drive the real
  adapters this way, on a fake io. These tests prove nothing a caller
  sees has changed.
- **Existing seams reused:** `tests/resolver-kit/resolver.test.ts`, whose
  fake adapter moves to the new interface; the adapter-level tests in
  `tests/cli-resolver/cli.test.ts` and `tests/t3-resolver/t3.test.ts`,
  which call `run` and `start` in place of `spawn` and `waitForResult`.

## Scrutiny Tier & Blast Radius

- **Tier:** medium
- **Blast radius:** the `Adapter` interface in the kit, the kit's
  adapter layer (`resolver.ts`), and the two adapters that implement it.
  No other package imports `adapter.ts`. The wire protocol is untouched.

## Decisions

### The new interface

```ts
// The request for a read-only session. A null model is the harness's
// default for the family.
export type RunInput = { name: string; prompt: string; cwd: string; family: Family; model: string | null; effort: Effort };
// The request for an interactive session.
export type StartInput = Omit<RunInput, 'effort'>;

export type Adapter = {
  name, program, harness, handleKind, detect, whyDeclined?, options, finish, // as now
  run(input: RunInput, options: { timeoutMs: number }): Promise<{ handle: Handle; text: string }>;
  start?(input: StartInput): Promise<Handle>;
};
```

`SpawnRequest`, `Session`, `spawn`, `waitForResult` and `verbs` go.

The names `RunInput` and `StartInput` differ from the wire types
`RunRequest` and `StartRequest` in `protocol.ts`, so the kit can import
both without aliases.

Alternatives: keep `spawn` and `waitForResult` and only tighten the
types. That leaves cli faking a spawn. A single `session(kind, ...)`
method keeps the nullable effort. Two methods are the smallest shape that
fits both adapters.

### The kit's adapter layer

- `takes(adapter, verb)` becomes: `run` is always taken, and `start` is
  taken when `adapter.start` is defined. The decline messages stay word
  for word.
- `start`: `return { resolver, handle: await adapter.start!({ name, prompt, cwd, ...modelOf(model) }) }`.
- `run`: call `adapter.run`, then reject an empty text with
  `SessionFailed('empty final message (<kind> <id>)')`, then answer as
  now. The try/catch, the `where` suffix and the call to `finish` on
  `Refused` go.

### Who names the session in an error

Only the adapter knows the handle when `run` throws. t3 wraps its wait in
a try/catch that appends ` (thread <id>)` to any kit error, as the kit
did. cli appends nothing: its handle's id is the session name, which the
caller sent. Tests that match cli's stderr by pattern still pass; any
that expect `(process <name>)` drop it.

### t3's `run` and `start`

Both share one private `launchThread(request, { readOnly, effort })`,
which is today's `spawn` body with `kind === 'start'` replaced by
`!readOnly`. Today's `waitForResult` body becomes a private
`waitForText(handle, timeoutMs)`.

`run` works in two steps:

1. It launches the thread with `readOnly: true`. An error here, such as
   no T3 project for the repository, passes through unchanged. No thread
   exists yet, so there is nothing to archive or name.
2. It waits for the text inside a try/catch. Only this step can fail
   after the thread exists. On `Refused`, `run` archives the thread with
   the same `dispatch` call that `finish` makes. If archiving throws,
   `run` appends `; could not archive it: <why>` to the refusal's
   message. For any kit error, it then appends ` (thread <id>)` and
   rethrows. The exit stays 3 for a refusal, and stderr names the
   thread, as the spec requires.

`start` is: launch with `readOnly: false` and a null effort, and return
the handle. `t3ModelSelection` keeps its nullable effort: that is t3's
own rule for gemini on a start, not part of the interface.

### cli's `run`

Today's `waitForResult` body, taking the request directly. The fake
`spawn`, the `CliSession` type, its cast and `effort!` go. It returns
`{ handle: { kind: 'process', id: name }, text }`. It has no `start`, and
no `verbs` field.

On a refusal cli does no cleanup. It already removes an old result file
before it runs, so a refusal leaves at most an empty file in
`.workspace/lets-delegate/`, which is scratch space.

### No ADR

The interface is internal to this repository and easy to change again.
Nothing here is costly to reverse.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [A behavior change slips in, such as a different exit code or a
  missing thread archive] → The end-to-end tests in
  `tests/t3-resolver/resolver.test.ts` and
  `tests/cli-resolver/resolver.test.ts` stay and must pass unchanged in
  what they assert about exit codes and archiving.
- [t3 no longer has the kit's warning line when an archive fails; the
  reason moves into the error message] → The spec asks only that the
  exit stays 3 and stderr names the thread. Both hold.
- [cli's stderr loses `(process <name>)` on a failed run] → The name is
  the request's own `name`, so nothing is lost. `lets` copies a
  resolver's stderr through and never parses it (`lets/src/delegate/review.ts`).

## Migration & Rollback

N/A. Nothing persistent changes shape. Rolling back is a revert of the
code commits.
