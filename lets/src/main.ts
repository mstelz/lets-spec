const SYNC_HELP = `
Keeps the lets-spec rules in a marked block of AGENTS.md: creates
AGENTS.md with only the block when it is missing, appends the block when
AGENTS.md lacks it, and rewrites the block when it is out of date. The
project owns the rest of the file, and commits the block with it.

Creates each other file the project owns when it is missing:
openspec/config.yaml from the release's template, and the CLAUDE.md and
.claude/skills links. It never edits one that exists, and names each file
it creates or changes.

Copies each skill into .agents/skills, and each schema into openspec/schemas.
With LETS_SPEC_SKILLS=committed, the default, the project commits them.
With LETS_SPEC_SKILLS=ignored, lets sync keeps a block in .gitignore that
ignores them.

Then it warns if:
- the rules block in AGENTS.md has a marker without its pair
- openspec/config.yaml is invalid, or names a schema other than the release's
  default
- CLAUDE.md is not a link to AGENTS.md, or .claude/skills is not a link to
  ../.agents/skills

It prints nothing when all is well, and exits 0 even when it warns, so a
problem never stops the shell from starting.

With --check, it changes nothing, and exits 1 if the rules block in
AGENTS.md is missing or out of date. With LETS_SPEC_SKILLS=committed, it
also exits 1 if a copied skill differs from the release, or .gitignore
still has the skills block. With LETS_SPEC_SKILLS=ignored, it exits 1 if
.gitignore lacks a current skills block. Run it in CI.

WORKFLOW_RELEASE names the release folder. Without it, LETS_SPEC_FLOW
(default standard) picks one of the releases that ship with lets.
The Nix wrapper sets WORKFLOW_RELEASE.`;

const DELEGATE_HELP = `
Each delegation has a strategy and an intent. The strategy is how the
session runs: review runs it read-only and waits for its answer, and
handoff starts an interactive session and returns at once. The intent is
what it is for: plan or code for a review, and apply for a handoff. Each
strategy has two commands: instructions says what can run and gives the
user's guidance, and run runs it.

A resolver turns each request into a real session. Three are built into
lets: t3 starts sessions in T3 Code, cli runs a family's CLI headless, and
subagent, the default, starts none. lets asks each resolver your config
lists under delegate.resolvers, in order, and stops at the first that does
not decline. Nothing is run from PATH.

The config is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lets/config.yaml, or
~/.config/lets/config.yaml when XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset or empty. You
write it by hand:

  version: 3
  delegate:
    resolvers:
      - t3
      - subagent
    review:
      code:
        guidance: Prefer the strongest gpt model.
    handoff:
      apply:
        guidance: Prefer claude.

Each entry under delegate.resolvers is t3, cli or subagent. With no
config, or no delegate.resolvers, only subagent is asked. It starts no
session: a review exits 3, and a handoff gives back the prompt to carry on
by hand.

review and handoff are optional. delegate.<strategy>.<intent>.guidance is
prose that the skill reads to rank the models; only instructions reads it.

Run lets delegate from the repo root.`;

stdout: the session's final message.
stderr: one JSON line with for, resolver, family, model, independent,
handle, gitClean and durationSeconds. for is the intent --for gave.
independent is true when the family that answered is not the source
family.

--model may be given more than once, best first. When the resolver
refuses a model, lets asks the same resolver for the next one.

Exit codes:
  0  the final message is on stdout
  2  usage error, or every resolver in the config declined
  3  no fresh session can run here on any model given: the harness or the
     account said no before the model gave any output. The harness is not
     running or not set up, there are no tokens left, it cannot run the
     model, or no resolver started a session. stderr names each model and
     why.
